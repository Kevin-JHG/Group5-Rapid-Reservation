## User Registration
**Feature Description**: The user registration feature allows new customers to create an account by providing personal details, ensuring they can securely log in and access services such as table reservations, pre-ordering, and receiving updates. This feature aims to simplify the onboarding process, validate user input, and enhance security by ensuring the uniqueness of each account.
 - Key Functionalities:
   - Input Fields: Users must provide essential details, including name, email, phone number, and password.
   - Password Validation: The system enforces password strength by requiring a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Email Validation: The system checks for a valid email format and ensures it is not already in use.
   - Phone Number Validation: A valid phone number format is required, with optional two-factor authentication for security.
   - Unique Account Creation: The system ensures that each email and phone number is associated with only one account.
   - Confirmation: Upon successful registration, users receive a confirmation email or SMS to verify their account.
   - Optional Profile Setup: After registration, users can set preferences (e.g., dietary restrictions, preferred seating) for future use.
 - Acceptance Criteria:
   1. The user must be able to input their name, email, phone number, and password to register.
   2. The system should validate email and phone number formats before allowing registration.
   3. Passwords must meet strength requirements (e.g., minimum 8 characters, including numbers and symbols).
   4. Duplicate email or phone numbers should prompt an error message, preventing multiple registrations.
   5. A verification email or SMS should be sent to confirm the registration process.
   6. After successful registration, users are redirected to their account dashboard.
