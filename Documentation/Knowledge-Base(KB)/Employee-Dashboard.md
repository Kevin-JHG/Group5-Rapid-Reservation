## Employee Dashboard
**Feature Description**: The Employee Dashboard serves as a centralized hub for restaurant staff to manage reservations, view and track orders, update table availability, and monitor special requests.

 - Key Functionalities:
   - Reservation Management: Staff can view upcoming reservations in a list or calendar format, with details including customer names, party sizes, reservation times, and assigned tables. Filters by date and time allow easy access to specific reservations.
   - Order Tracking and Status Updates: Displays all pre-orders linked to reservations, categorized by table and time. Staff can mark orders as "In Progress" or "Completed," ensuring efficient kitchen operations and timely service.
   - Table Availability Control: Managers can update table availability in real-time, closing tables for maintenance or blocking off sections for special events, ensuring accurate information for customer reservations.
   - Special Request Monitoring: Reservations flagged with special requests (e.g., dietary restrictions, seating preferences) are highlighted for quick review, allowing staff to make necessary accommodations.
   - Event and Large Party Management: The dashboard provides tools to manage large group reservations and special events, allowing staff to block off multiple tables, assign waitstaff, and review event-specific requirements.
   - Employee Roles and Permissions: The dashboard supports different access levels, ensuring that each staff role has access only to the relevant information and tools (e.g., only managers can adjust table availability).
   - Real-Time Notifications to Customers: Staff can send instant updates to customers about reservation changes (e.g., table reassignment or unavailable menu items), with notifications sent via email or SMS based on customer preference.
